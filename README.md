# Explorative Information Visualization Project

## Intro

The visualization was made within the scope of the lecture Explorative
Information Visualization at Aalto University, by Benjamin Springer. It shows
the mean broadband speed of countries worldwide, in Megabytes per second.

The following interactions are possible:

- Drag and zoom around the map to explore different countries.
- Hover over a country to see its' name and broadband speed.
- Choose a file size and click on a country to experience the broadband speed
  for yourself.

## Running the Project

- Online: available
  [here](https://benjaminspringer98.github.io/explorative-information-viz/)
- Locally:
  1. Install the free code editor VSCode and download the Live Server extension.
  2. If accessing through git: clone the project
  3. Open the project folder in VSCode, and click the "Go Live" button in the bottom right

## Notes

- Used dataset is in the project directory
- Original dataset can be requested
  [here](https://worldpopulationreview.com/country-rankings/internet-speeds-by-country)
- Data was originally in Megabits per second, but was changed to Megabytes per
  second, because people are used to this notation from daily experiences (e.g.,
  downloading a file of 100 Megabytes rather than 800 Megabits).
